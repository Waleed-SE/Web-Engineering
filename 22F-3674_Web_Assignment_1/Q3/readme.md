# Q3: String Transformation Tool

## Implementation Details
I created an interactive tool that processes a user-inputted string by reversing it while skipping characters at a dynamically calculated interval. The skip interval is determined by summing the digits of the roll number.

## Features
- Extracts digits from the roll number and sums them to determine the skip interval.
- Reverses the string while skipping every N-th character.
- Preserves original positions of spaces.
- Displays the original and transformed string dynamically.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- DOM Manipulation
- Reduce, Map, Arrow Functions

## How to Use
1. Enter a string and roll number.
2. Click the "Transform" button.
3. See the transformed output instantly.
