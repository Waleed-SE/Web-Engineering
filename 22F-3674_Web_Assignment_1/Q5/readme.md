# Q5: E-Commerce Discount System

## Implementation Details
I developed an e-commerce discount system where students enter their roll number to get a dynamically generated discount on a product. The discount percentage is based on the middle two digits of the roll number but capped at 50%.

## Features
- Extracts discount percentage from the roll number.
- Displays a list of products with prices.
- Allows users to select multiple products and set quantities.
- Dynamically updates the total price with discounts.
- Uses reduce() to calculate final prices with multiple discounts.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- DOM Manipulation
- Set, Reduce, Arrow Functions

## How to Use
1. Enter your roll number to apply a discount.
2. Select products and quantities.
3. See the total price update in real time.
